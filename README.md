AFA Fixed Fee Risk Model

Professional Services Pricing | Margin & Risk Evaluation Tool

📌 Project Overview

This project develops a structured risk evaluation model for fixed-fee (Alternative Fee Arrangement – AFA) engagements in professional services.

Unlike hourly billing, fixed-fee pricing introduces financial risk because revenue is fixed while cost varies with hours worked. This model helps evaluate whether a proposed engagement meets margin targets and maintains sufficient risk buffer before approval.

🎯 Business Objective

To determine:

Whether the engagement achieves target margin

The break-even hour threshold

The margin erosion point

Sensitivity of profit to hour increases

Impact of resource mix on cost structure

🧠 Key Pricing Concepts Applied

📈 Example Insight

The model demonstrates how increased senior resource involvement raises weighted cost per hour, reduces break-even buffer, and increases financial risk in fixed-fee engagements.

💡 Strategic Application

This model supports pricing teams in:

Evaluating financial exposure before proposal submission

Protecting target margins

Managing resource allocation risk

Supporting data-driven commercial negotiations
