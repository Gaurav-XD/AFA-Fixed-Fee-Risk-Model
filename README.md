Fixed Fee (AFA) Risk &amp; Margin Sensitivity Model for Professional Services Pricing

AFA Fixed Fee Risk Model
📌 Project Overview

This project evaluates financial risk in fixed-fee (Alternative Fee Arrangement) engagements within professional services. The model helps assess profitability, break-even thresholds, margin sensitivity, and resource mix impact before approving client proposals.

🎯 Business Objective

Meets target margin requirements

Has sufficient break-even buffer

Can absorb scope increases

Requires pricing adjustments

📈 Example Insight

The model demonstrates how increased Partner involvement raises weighted cost per hour, reduces break-even buffer, and increases pricing risk.

💡 Strategic Application

This model supports pricing teams in:
