## 🔍 Executive Summary

Fixed-fee engagements shift financial risk from the client to the firm.
While revenue is predetermined, cost depends on actual hours and staffing mix.

This model evaluates whether a proposed engagement:

Meets target margin requirements

Maintains sufficient break-even buffer

Can absorb scope expansion

Requires pricing or staffing adjustments

It provides a structured, decision-ready financial risk framework prior to proposal approval.

## 🎯 Business Problem

Under fixed-fee engagements:

Risk Factor	Impact
Revenue is fixed	No upside if hours increase
Hours may exceed estimates	Direct cost escalation
Senior resource involvement	Raises weighted cost
Margin erosion	Begins before break-even

Without structured analysis, firms may approve engagements that appear profitable but are financially unstable.

## 🧠 Analytical Framework

This model applies core pricing and financial risk concepts:

Concept	Purpose
Break-even Analysis	Identify hour threshold where profit = 0
Margin Threshold Analysis	Identify when margin falls below target
Weighted Cost Modeling	Simulate staffing impact
Sensitivity Analysis	Measure profit volatility across hours
Risk Classification	Categorize engagement health
