Detailed Project Explanation – AFA Fixed Fee Risk Model
1. Problem Context

In professional services firms (law, consulting, advisory), fixed-fee engagements transfer financial risk from the client to the firm. While revenue is predetermined, actual cost depends on hours worked and staffing composition.

If actual hours exceed estimates, margin erodes and losses may occur.

2. Financial Risk Mechanism

Revenue (Fixed Fee) = Constant
Cost = Hours × Weighted Cost per Hour

Profit = Revenue − Cost

Break-even occurs when:

Revenue = Cost

Margin erosion begins before break-even when profit falls below target margin threshold.

3. Resource Mix Impact

Weighted Cost per Hour is calculated as:

(Partner Cost × Partner %)

(Senior Cost × Senior %)

(Junior Cost × Junior %)

This allows modeling how staffing decisions affect:

Break-even point

Profit sensitivity

Margin buffer

4. Risk Zones Identified

The model categorizes outcomes into:

Above Target Margin

Below Target Margin

Loss

This enables proactive decision-making before engagement approval.

5. Strategic Implications

The analysis highlights that margin risk often begins well before break-even. Even profitable engagements may underperform if margin targets are not protected.

The model demonstrates the importance of:

Pricing discipline

Resource planning

Risk-adjusted fixed-fee setting
